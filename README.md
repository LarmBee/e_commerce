The logo is accessible in the left corner of the navigation bar. This acts as the default "send to home " button" and can be used throughout the application to return back to the main section

## Adding to Cart
All the products shown can be added to the cart via the add to cart button which is located in every item card on the bottom right . After clicking it there is a slight lag but you can see it added and there will be an increment in the number of items in the main cart (Top right) 

## Viewing items in Cart.
You can view items in the cart by clicking on the cart button (Top right of the navigation bar) . It will open a new window showing all your current items along with the quantity you have added to the cart and the total of each individual item 

## Delete items from Cart

You can delete items from the cart via the delete button but if you decrease the number past 1 it automatically deleted. You can also clear the cart using the clear button
